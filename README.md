# Bronze-Medal-Solution-CommonLit-Competition
Thie repository provides my solution for the Kaggle Competition - CommonLit - Evaluate Student Summaries. The goal of the competition was to assess the quality of summaries written by students in grades 3-12, and by that assist teachers in evaluating the quality of student work and help learning platforms provide immediate feedback to students.
